Workshop Materials and Slides
==============================
We have taught several workshops on using pyparrot.  As we continue to teach and develop materials for
pyparrot, we will continue to share the curriculum materials here.  Since the 2018 OK workshop slides supercede the
GCER 2018 slides, we only share the 2018 OK Workshop slides for now.

* Morning slides from the OK workshop (focus on initial setup, initial flying) :download:`OK2018Morning.pdf <OK2018Morning.pdf>`

* Afternoon slides from the OK workshop (learning to use sensors, extra slides on vision though we did not discuss at workshop) :download:`OK2018Afternoon.pdf <OK2018Afternoon.pdf>`.
